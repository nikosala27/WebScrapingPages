# WebScrapingPages

- Program with simple GUI to scrap selected pages. Minimum sleep is set to 1 second so that it won't damage any of this pages by too many requests.
- There is possibility to choose one page or tell program to scrap all possivle pages
- Program might not scrap all of he pages now because as we now things on web pages change, they are dynamic
- It collects attributes of products like: name, SKU, price, category...
  
I shared this program by .exe using pyInstaller and added simple log in mechanism based on google spreadsheets API.
